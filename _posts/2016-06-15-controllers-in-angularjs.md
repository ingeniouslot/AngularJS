A controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function. Controllers are used to control the data of angular applications. They contains attributes/properties and functions.

## To create a controller
{% highlight javascript %}
(function(){
    // creating a module
    angular.module('app', []);

    // controller function
    function MainController() {

    }

    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('MainController', MainController);
})();
{% endhighlight %}


## Attach controller to DOM

When a controller is attached to the DOM Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function.

You can attach controller to DOM in two different ways:

1. Controller is attached to the DOM via the **ng-controller** directive.

{% highlight HTML %}

<div ng-controller="MainController">
  ...
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

2. Declaring it in a route definition via the **$route** service.

**Note:** A common mistake is to declare the controller again using ng-controller in the template itself. This will cause the controller to be attached and executed twice.
